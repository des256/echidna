browsers are currently owned by the big companies, and we want that to free up, because it's old tech

unreal is branching out to record movies with AR/VR tech, pretty soon they branch out further and own that space too

oculus is facebook, and pretty closed off, kinda like Apple

now listen up to this extremely dreamy and naive story, which is actually really cool:

using WASM and Rust we can break these problems

and design a real modern AR/VR context from the ground up

redefine 'the browser' to cover three important things:

    0. everything is a WASM blob

    1. allow multiple people, either in the same space or calling in with VR, to interact in 3D by combining their hardware into a single secure distributed system, a bubble

    2. completely share all available hardware for the app, parts of an app automatically migrate around the hardware to find the optimal place

    3. from participating users, register as much real human interactions as possible; standardizing body poses, facial expressions, hand gestures, etc. on top of key presses and mouse clicks

I'm already building up the basic technology for a bunch of available hardware

huge networking questions that have already been solved, but will need to be addressed properly

we make a few exploration apps that show off the use of this sort of technology

while doing that, we start to understand better and better what the app should look like and what kinds of APIs we should provide

keeping the discussion going, a killer app will appear; this could just be shared art, or a boring conference room, or a game idea

big business ideas:

    asana+calendar+slack+figma+etc. functionality accessed by just joining the business bubble, accessing everything by just looking at it and pointing at it!!

    medical and engineering training (this very likely already exists in AR/VR land)

    design+develop booster hardware, packed with hires 360 cameras, lidar, microphones, and processing power to extract human interaction from the group
