# Introduction

## What is it?

Orbital (https://github.com/orbitalweb) is a project to explore possibilities for a new browser. It is believed that the way forward is a microkernel that manages a bunch of tiny WASM modules.

faasm is a project where a microkernel manages a bunch of tiny WASM modules.

This should be the core of a new ecosystem.

The new ecosystem has to be 3D and interact with groups of humans and/or social robots.

The new ecosystem has to live in an ecosystem of interconnected hardware.

The new ecosystem has to have access to everything that happens around, especially human social information.

It should be possible to run a python session as WASM process.

It should be ridiculously easy to develop application software in this ecosystem.

That way, the new ecosystem can supply much better group apps.

That way, robots can connect to a group perception system, regardless of their own limited capabilities (i.e. Siri breaks its confinement and provides much better interaction).

That way, specific hardware can be used to boost the capabilities of both humans and robots.

This technology should not be Google/Facebook/etc. but something independent, small and open source.

This technology should work radically everywhere.

AI algorithms are not the focus here.

## Take 2

The future of browsing consists of an ecosystem with 3 main points:

1. ubiquitous 3D interfaces in AR/VR for groups of people working together

    Think of a 3D game of Jenga in AR, where multiple people touch the virtual tower of blocks
    Think of a group engineering session, where a teacher explains how a device works, while everyone stands around and points at things
    Think of a conversation space, where people from all over can meet and chat, in VR and AR

2. shared hardware of all people in the group

    Everyone participating in the group allows their hardware to be used for the app.
    All cameras, screens, buttons, laptop microphones, speakers, etc.

3. automatic ubiquitous understanding of what's happening in reality, especially human social signals

    All hardware together builds up a 3D understanding of reality, including what everyone is doing and saying. This is the app input.
    The more hardware, the higher quality this understanding.

## Take 4

After reading up on WebXR, ROS2, OpenCV, etc. it seems the challenge in the end will be in:
